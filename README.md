# 6X6-Suduko

import java.util.*;

This line imports the entire java.util package, which contains classes for working with collections, input/output, and more.
class Pk

This line defines a new class named Pk. This class contains several static methods and variables used to handle the game's logic.
static boolean Result(int save[][])

This line defines a static method named Result, which takes a 2D integer array save as its parameter.
It returns a boolean indicating whether the game is won or not.
int r=0, c=0, row=0, column=0, count=0;

Declares and initializes several integer variables that will be used to track the state of the game.
10-66: The Result method checks for winning conditions in the Sudoku game by examining rows and columns:

It iterates through rows and columns of the 2D array save, looking for non-zero values (assumed Sudoku values).
It creates temporary arrays to store non-zero values in each row and column.
It checks if each row and column contains 15 different non-zero values (representing 1 to 6).
If all rows and columns meet this condition, the game is won.
The method returns false if the game is won, indicating that the Sudoku puzzle is solved; otherwise, it returns true.
static void Print()
This method is used to print the initial state of the Sudoku board with a grid of cells labeled with numbers and letters (A to F).
70-96: The Print method prints the initial Sudoku board:

It uses nested loops to construct the grid and labels for rows and columns.
It prints numbers from 1 to 6 as column labels and letters from A to F as row labels.
It creates a visual representation of the Sudoku grid with dashes and vertical bars.
static String Str()
This method is used to read a string input from the user and convert it to uppercase.
static Integer value()
- This method is used to read an integer input from the user.

static void Box(int num, char ch, int value, int save[][])
- This method takes a row number num, a character representing a column ch, a value, and the Sudoku board (save) as parameters.
- It updates the board with the given value at the specified position.

106-189: The Box method updates the Sudoku board:

It maps the row number, column character, and value to the corresponding position in the save array.
It prints the updated Sudoku board with the new value at the specified position.
public class Suduko
This line defines the main class Sudoku.
public static void main(String[] args)
The main method of the program, where the game starts. It takes an array of strings as input arguments but doesn't use them in this program.
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
Creates a Scanner object for user input.
Pk.Print();
Calls the Print method to display the initial Sudoku board.
199-211: User input and gameplay loop:

The program enters a loop where the user is prompted to enter a position (e.g., "1A") and a value (1 to 6) for the Sudoku puzzle.
It uses the methods from the Pk class to handle input, update the board, and check for a win condition.
The loop continues until the game is won, at which point it displays a victory message and exits.
sc.close();
Closes the Scanner object when the program ends.
This code provides a simple text-based Sudoku game where the user can interact with the puzzle by entering positions and values until they successfully complete it.
